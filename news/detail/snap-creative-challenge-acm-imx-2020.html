  <p> What will storytelling look like in a world where AR is more prevalent? </p>
  <p> Snap Research organized a virtual&nbsp;<a href="https://imx.acm.org/2020/creative-challenge/"
      rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Creative Challenge at ACM IMX</a>, an academic conference focused on
    interactive media and television, to explore that exact question.&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> &nbsp;“The printing press, radio, and television each brought in a new wave of storytelling. We’re just starting
      to see the new genres coming up with AR,” said Seattle-based Principal Research Scientist Andrés Monroy-Hernández.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Over the course of four months, Snap Research and their collaborators Mar Gonzalez Franco from Microsoft Research
    and Vinoba Vinayagamoorthy from the BBC R&amp;D, mentored a select group of 11 university teams from eight countries
    — challenging fellow researchers to reimagine AR storytelling.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> “Our goal was for every AR project to reflect a core part of Snap’s mission: having fun and living in the moment
    together,” said Senior Research Scientist Rajan Vaish.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> What resulted were new use cases of AR storytelling — from creating an interactive AR garden for hospital patients
    to retelling an 11th-century Indian story in a shared AR space.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> “Especially in a time of quarantine, there’s a growing interest in how AR can provide an outlet for creative
    expression,” said Andrés.&nbsp; </p>
